Hello world
Earth's humble treasure,
In the warmth, they softly lie—
Golden, crisp delight.
Swamp green ogre roars,  
Donkey's laughter fills the air,  
Fiona, love's prize.
Silent code whispers,
In the night, logic dances,
Dreams of dawn arise.
Golden leaves now fall.
Gentle breezes softly sigh.
Winter’s near at hand.
## Goodbye world
